The file with all the code is called main

Game is now on Steam with its new title:  Short Hop Laser
Its only 1$ so consider trying it :) 

I have removed the exe and data files here but will keep the python code up if people want to read it.

I may add to the game to include levels, boss fights, and a tutorial in the future if i feel up to it.

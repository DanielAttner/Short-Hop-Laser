The file with all the code is called jews.... should have probably changed that
The file with all the pictures i use is called game



[Space]  shoots laser
[A] left
[S] down
[D] right
[M] jump
[LShift] walk


This demo is a proof of concept for the full game
Therefore it does not include, but will eventually have:
-menus
-levels
-enemies
-story
-sound

This is just a demo of falco's movement and abilities
Goal is to make a melee-like mini game out of falco's short hop laser from melee
Move set does not include:
-double jump
-full hop
-wavedash
-dashdance
-any attacks other than laser

although i might add some of these features in future....
